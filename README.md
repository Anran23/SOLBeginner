# SOLBeginner
In this section of the project we were taught on how we could mint and burn solana tokens. 

We were tasked to write a code about a token with our selected name and abbreviation, and through that token we should be able to run it and see the if we could mint a certain amount of tokens, if we could burn that token, and another condition wherein if the total number of burn is greater than the amount of the available mint, the burn will not go through. 

## Functionalities 
``mint``
In the mint section of the code, you could input a certain amount of number in which you want mint. 
``burn``
In the burn section, you could input a certain amount to burn meaning you will subtract that to the total mint, if the number you are trying to burn is greater than the total number of minted token, it will not go through. 

##Variables
``Name``
``Abbrv``
